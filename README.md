People unfamiliar with financial management can query on this chatbot for advices. The chatbot is trained on financial management data.

### Problem Statement
Manually taking care of finances is time-consuming and complicated, it takes a long time to to examine and compute spending habits, forecast money trends, identify unnecessary spending, and offer personalized budgeting tips, making managing finances simpler and more convenient.

### Solution
Our solution leverages the capabilities of artificial intelligence to make financial management more manageable. By incorporating a Gemini model, we offer an AI-powered chatbot that provides real-time financial guidance. We offer an ML model for assisting users in analyzing expenses, forecasting trends, identifying unnecessary expenditures, and receiving tailored budget recommendations.

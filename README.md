People unfamiliar with financial management can query on this chatbot for advices. The chatbot is trained on financial management data.

### Problem Statement
Manually taking care of finances is time-consuming and complicated, it takes a long time to to examine and compute spending habits, forecast money trends, identify unnecessary spending, and offer personalized budgeting tips, making managing finances simpler and more convenient.
